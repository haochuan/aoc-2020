My rust solution for https://adventofcode.com/2020

I'm using [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) as the base for the solutions, it's super awesome!

- For config see [cargo-aoc](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc)
- To get input files: `cargo aoc input`
- To run your solution code: `cargo aoc`
